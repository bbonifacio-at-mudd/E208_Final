## Instructions for Working/Running the Code

How to open notebook in google collab:
Go to https://colab.research.google.com/. 

When opening a notebook, enter the url for this repo as shown in the image below. The most up-to-date version of the notebook will be the Primary Notebook.

After you open the Primary notebook, there's one more step in order to save any changes you make. Hit **File** and then **Save to Github** as shown below. 
You have a choice to either overwrite the current **Primary Notebook** or to save your changes to a new notebook. Do whichever is appropriate. 
But as a general rule of thumb, if you were just experimenting with changing stuff, save it to a new notebook. If your changes are significant, clean, and 
are appropriate for future notebooks to be branched from, overwrite the Primary Notebook. If not, there's never any harm in saving to a new notebook.
