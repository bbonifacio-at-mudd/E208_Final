info 
{
  ## Required ##

  "version" : str,

  "year" : int,
  "contributor" : str
  "date_created" : datetime

  ## Required ##

  # Precise date formats have varied a little across datasets, the spirit is
  # "any obvious format that dateutil knows how to parse".  Going forward,
  # we are using Python's standard string representation for datetimes, which
  # looks like: 
  #
  # 2022-12-31 09:52:50
  "datetime": datetime,  

  # A unique identifier for the sequence (aka burst, episode, or event) to 
  # which this image belongs
  "seq_id": str,

  # The total number of images in this event
  "seq_num_frames": int,

  # The zero-indexed index of this image within this event
  "frame_num": int
  
  # This is an int in older data sets, but convention is now strings
  "location": str,
  
  # Image corruption is quite common in camera trap images, and throwing out corrupt
  # images in database assembly is "dodging part of the problem".  Wherever possible,
  # use this flag to indicate that an image failed to load, e.g. in PIL and/or TensorFlow.
  "corrupt": bool

category
{
  ## Required ##
  
  # Category ID 0 reserved for the class "empty"; all other categories vary by data
  # set.  Non-negative integers only.
  "id" : int,

  # Can be any string, but if the category indicates empty, the standard is "empty"
  # (as opposed to "blank", "false trigger", "none", "misfire", etc.). 
  #
  # Lower-case names without spaces are encouraged, but not required.  I.e., all other
  # things being equal, use "gray_wolf" rather than "Gray Wolf".
  "name" : str

annotation
{
  ## Required ##

  "id" : str,
  "image_id" : str,  
  "category_id" : int,
  
  ## Optional ##
  
  # These are in absolute, floating-point coordinates, with the origin at the upper-left
  "bbox": [x,y,width,height],
  
  # This indicates that this annotation is really applied at the *sequence* level,
  # and may not be reliable at the individual-image level.  Since the *sequences* are
  # the "atom of interest" for most ecology applications, this is common.
